# Kaggle-DigitRecognizer-CNN

## Overview
This is a kaggle competition project coding in `Python`. In this project, the goal is to correctly identify the handwritten single digit by training a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. More information about the competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer#description).

## Details
This program utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network to achieve the goal. The CNN contains two convolution layers, two max pooling layers and two fully connected layers.

Training dataset and test dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data).

## Performance
Two versions were submitted (Score up to 98.8%).
